# Yogananth Portfolio Website

## Project Overview
This is my **personal portfolio website**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The website showcases my skills, projects, and contact information, providing a professional online presence.  

The site is fully responsive and visually appealing, with interactive sections like a contact form, smooth scrolling, and a styled footer.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Structuring the website  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – Interactivity and dynamic behavior  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control  
- **Netlify** – Hosting and deployment  
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)** – Automated deployment workflow

## Project Features
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- Contact form with validation  
- Smooth scrolling and interactive navigation  
- Styled footer and multiple sections for projects and information  
- Automatic deployment to Netlify using GitHub Actions  

---

## Deployment and CI/CD
- The website is hosted on **Netlify**: [Live Site Link](https://yoga-prj.netlify.app)  
- I have set up a **CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions**, so every time I push updates to the `main` branch on GitHub, the workflow automatically deploys the latest changes to Netlify.  
- This ensures that the live site is always up-to-date without manual intervention.

## Development Process
1. Developed the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
2. Version-controlled the project with **Git** and pushed it to GitHub.  
3. Initially deployed the site manually on Netlify.  
4. Implemented **CI/CD** using GitHub Actions to automate deployment.  
5. Verified that updates to the code automatically reflect on the live site after every push.
